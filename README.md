# Lukas's-bruteforce-algorithm
   
There's a hash generator in the tools folder in order to test with your own password !   
    
The password cracking time is an exponential function of the length of the password, in other words the longer the password (and the more complex it is (example: with upper and lower case letters, numbers, special characters, etc...)) the longer it will take    
    
More versions are coming, still in development !   
No code or fragment of another bruteforce program is used, any similarity is involuntary   
Versions of the program are located in the versions folder   
The names of the versions are increasing (example : V1 then V2 ...)   
Any suggestions are accepted, my code is probably not optimized since I am not expert in python   
Please don't use this program unless you have explicit permission from the owner of the account/password or the company !   
   
For educational use only !
